Overview: 
      - Aplha project: a 2D multiplayer plateformer shooter game. Using client-server. 2 players will combat each other using guns, the player can jump, go forwards and backwards and crouch; most of these actions are there to help the player navigate the battlefield as well as avoid opponents' shots. Each player has 3 lives, when a player is touched by a bullet, he looses 1 life; if the player manages to dodge the bullet he gets awarded 1 Su-Pa point, once the player has 5 Su-Pa points they can use "mirror shield" to deflect opponents' bullet thus mirroring it pathway, in most case scenarios this will reverse in the "shooting" player having to defend himself against the incoming bullet. The server will be accessible from anywhere in the world as well as within LANs, this is to allow for players to play either only witht their friends or with other players and across the world, that would include Communist China, Russia, Iran and People's Democratic Republic of Korea (if they dont block the servers - which is what theyre most likely to do)
